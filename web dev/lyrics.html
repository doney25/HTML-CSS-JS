        You're fighting me off like a firefighter
So tell me why you still get burned
You say you're not, but you're still a liar
'Cause I'm the one that you run to first
</span>
<div style="background-color: blue;">
Every time, yeah
Why do you try to deny it
When you show up every night
And tell me that you want me but it's complicated
So complicated
